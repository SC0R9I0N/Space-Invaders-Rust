# Space-Invaders-Rust
Space Invaders game to learn the syntax and usage of Rust.

Previously, my go-to application for learning a new language was Pong, but I want to have this serve as my transition into making Space Invaders my go-to starting project

This project is aiming to be a 1:1 replication of the original Space Invaders.
I am first going to finish my original Rust project with Pong, but then I will be simultaneously working on my DND script and this project.
